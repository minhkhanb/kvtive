Check for Node and npm

Make sure that you've installed Node and npm before attempting to install gulp.

node --version
npm --version
Install the gulp command

npm install --global gulp-cli
Create a package.json

If you don't have a package.json, create one. If you need help, run an npm init which will walk you through giving it a name, version, description, etc.

Install gulp in your devDependencies

Run this command in your project directory:

npm install --save-dev gulp
Create a gulpfile

In your project directory, create a file named gulpfile.js in your project root with these contents:

var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  // place code for your default task here
});
Test it out

Run the gulp command in your project directory:

gulp
To run multiple tasks, you can use gulp <task> <othertask>.
